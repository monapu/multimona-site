<h2>How to run MultiMona from a USB drive</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Installing MultiMona to run on a USB drive for Windows.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Insert your USB drive into your PC.</li>
  <li>Run the MultiMona Windows installer. On the screen with the question "Select the installation path:" click on the
    "Browse" button and select a directory on your USB drive.
  </li>
  <li>Run the rest of the installation as normal.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is done, in Explorer navigate to your USB drive's MultiMona installation directory. It is the
    directory with the "multimona.exe" file.
  </li>
  <li>Create a new text file called (exactly) "multimona.properties". Leave the file empty.
    This is the MultiMona configuration file. Having a copy in the installation directory (rather than the user's
    application data) tells MultiMona to run locally.
  </li>
  <li>To run MultiMona locally, double click on the multimona.exe file.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have a single default wallet created, called multimona.wallet. You can create new ones using the 'Create
  Wallet' button and doing a save into your USB drive. You will be using a locally stored blockchain (called
  multimona.spvchain).</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Installing MultiMona to run on a USB drive for Linux.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Insert your USB drive into your Linux machine.</li>
  <li>Run the MultiMona Linux installer. On the screen with the question "Select the installation path:" click on the
    "Browse" button and select a directory on your USB drive.
  </li>
  <li>Run the rest of the installation as normal.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is done, navigate to your USB drive's MultiMona installation directory. It is the directory
    with the "multimona-exe.jar" file.
  </li>
  <li>Create a new text file called (exactly) "multimona.properties". Leave the file empty.
    This is the MultiMona configuration file. Having a copy in the installation directory (rather than the user's
    application data) tells MultiMona to run locally.
  </li>
  <li>To run MultiMona locally, double click on the multimona-exe.jar. If this does not start up the jar file, open a
    command line to your installation directory and run "java -jar multimona-exe.jar".
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>On a Mac, copy the entire MultiMona application onto your USB drive. The name of the application file will be
  MultiMona.app. Then go to where your wallets are stored and copy the files multimona.properties and
  multimona.spvchain onto your USB drive into the same directory. You can then double click the MultiMona.app
  on your USB drive to run MultiMona</p>
<h3>Notes and Limitations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The path of the wallets in the configuration file contains the USB drive letter which may change according to how
    many other drives you have plugged in. In this case the wallets other than multimona.wallet will not be found when
    MultiMona opens. You can just use the "Open Wallet" button to load them.
  </li>
  <li>With the instructions above, it assumes you have Java installed on the machine you plug into. You can also have a
    "Java Runtime Environment" stored on the USB too so that it is guaranteed to run. (More details to follow).
  </li>
  <li>The installer will add some shortcuts for running MultiMona pointing to the USB drive. These will not work if the
    USB drive is removed.
  </li>
</ol>
