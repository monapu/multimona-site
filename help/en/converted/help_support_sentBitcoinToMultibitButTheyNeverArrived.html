<h2>I sent monacoin to MultiMona but they never arrived</h2>
<h3>What is the symptom ?</h3>
<p>You sent some monacoin to MultiMona but the monacoin never arrived. There is no record of the transaction in MultiMona.</p>

<h3>What can you do about it ?</h3>
<p>The <strong>first thing to check</strong> is whether the monacoin was actually sent ok. You can do this as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Request the transaction id from the person or company that sent it to you.</li>
  <li>Check the transaction on <a href="https://blockchain.info" target="_blank">Blockchain.info</a> or <a href="http://blockexplorer.com" target="_blank">Monacoin Block Explorer</a> to be sure that it is actually on the Monacoin network.</li>
</ol>

<h3>I've verified that the transaction is on the blockchain and it's confirmed</h3>
<p>To get the missing transaction into your wallet:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the wallet in the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="img/yourWallets.png">&nbsp;Wallets' side panel to make it the active wallet.</li>
  <li>Go into the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="img/resetTransactions.png">&nbsp;Reset Blockchain and Transactions' menu option.</li>
  <li>Click on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="img/resetTransactions.png">&nbsp;Reset blockchain and transactions' button and let MultiMona sync the blockchain. Just leave MultiMona to work its way through the sync.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should then see the transaction in your wallet.</p>

<h3>I'm running an old version of MultiMona (before 0.5.16)</h3>
<p>Earlier versions of MultiMona did not show transactions that had inputs that were not confirmed. As this caused confusion this has been changed in version 0.5.16 so that these transactions are shown (unconfirmed). If you have an old version of MultiMona download the latest copy and install it. You will need to do a '<img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="img/resetTransactions.png">&nbsp;Reset blockchain and transactions' so that MultiMona can resync to see any transactions like this.</p>
