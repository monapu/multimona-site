<h2>What does 'The wallet is busy' mean ?</h2>
<p>Some tasks that you perform on the wallet can take a while, especially on large wallets. This includes importing and
  exporting private keys and changing the password protection. To enable you to carry on working, MultiMona runs these as
  a background task. When a background task is running for a wallet, there is a '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallet is busy" alt="Wallet is busy" src="img/hourglass.png">' shown
  for the wallet in the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="img/yourWallets.png">&nbsp;Wallets'
  panel. There is also a short note indicating what the wallet is busy with. This is typically: 'Synchronising. . .', 'Waiting. . .' etc.
</p>
<p>When the task finishes the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallet is busy" alt="Wallet is busy" src="img/hourglass.png">' disappears.</p>
<p>You can only have one background task running for a particular wallet. When a background task is running, various
  buttons and menu options are disabled. If you hover over one of these disabled buttons/ menu options there is a
  tooltip like 'The wallet is busy with the task "Exporting private keys" '. The buttons and menu options are re-enabled
  once the task has completed.</p>
<p>Each wallet has its own background task, so if one wallet is busy you can swop to another wallet and work with that
  instead.</p>
