<h2>How to backup your wallet using private keys</h2>

<p>You can export your private keys from a MultiMona wallet into a file (using the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Export private keys" alt="Export private keys" src="img/exportKey.png">&nbsp;Export
  private keys' option) and, as long as you do not manually create new receiving addresses, you can use the private key
  file as a backup for the wallet.</p>
<p>If something happened to your wallet and you want to recreate it do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new empty wallet.</li>
  <li>Import your private keys file using the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Import private keys" alt="Import private keys" src="img/importKey.png">&nbsp;Import
    private keys' option.
  </li>
  <li>MultiMona then adds the private keys from the file into the new wallet and replays the blockchain to get the
    transactions.
  </li>
</ol>
