<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>MultiMona is designed to be as easy to use as possible. It is intended for domestic (or small scale merchant) users who wish to use a desktop computer for their day to day
Monacoin transactions.</p>
<p>This guide will provide you with the first steps you should take after you have installed MultiMona so that you can be confident about how to get
things done safely.</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Password protect your wallet</h3>

wallet will not have a password so it will not be encrypted.</p>
<p>You should now <a href="help_walletTypes.html" target="_blank">password protect your wallet</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 2 - Locate your wallet files</h3>
<p>MultiMona is very careful to maintain backups of wallets and as such it is always useful to know where your wallets are being stored.</p>
<p>You can always see the file location of your current wallet in the main title bar of your MultiMona window. For instance, it might say: "MultiMona - My wallet - /Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiMona/multimona.wallet". The file name at the end is where your wallet is stored.</p>
