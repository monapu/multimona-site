<h2>Currency ticker</h2>
<p>The currency ticker is the small table that appears in the top right of the MultiMona screen. It shows the value of 1
  monacoin in various currencies. You can configure the ticker by clicking on it. This opens the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Preferences" alt="Preferences" src="img/preferences.png">&nbsp;Preferences'
  tab. Scroll down to the 'Currency ticker and exchange rate' section.</p>
<p>In the 'Currency ticker and exchange rate' section you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Select the 'Show currency ticker' checkbox to show the ticker. Unselect it to hide the ticker.</p></li>
  <li><p>Select the 'Show monacoin converted to fiat currency' checkbox to show fiat equivalents of your monacoin
    amounts.</p></li>
  <li><p>Select which columns you want to appear in the ticker.</p></li>
  <li><p>Choose which exchange and currency to show in the first row of the ticker. This currency is used for currency
    conversions if you have it enabled.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add a second row to the ticker and choose the exchange and currency to show.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To make the changes appear, click on the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Preferences" alt="Preferences" src="img/preferences.png">&nbsp;Apply changes' button.</p>
<p>You can quickly show or hide the currency ticker by using the 'View | <img width="16" height="16" title="Ticker" alt="Ticker" src="img/money.png">&nbsp;Show
  Currency Ticker' and 'View | <img width="16" height="16" title="Ticker" alt="Ticker" src="img/money.png">&nbsp;Hide
  Currency Ticker' menu options.</p>

<p><b>How to use the OpenExchangeRates exchange</b></p>
<p>As an anti-spam measure, OpenExchangeRates requires you to sign up for a free account with them before you can access their 150+ exchanges rates. You can do this within MultiMona. Here is a screen shot of the process:</p>
<img width="672" height="249" title="OpenExchangeRates" alt="OpenExchangeRates" src="img/openExchangeRates.png">
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the exchange "OpenExchangeRates" in the Exchange drop down control.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Press the "Get App ID button. This opens your browser to the sign up page "https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free?r=multimona"</p>
<p>Fill out the sign up page.</p>
<p>When you are signed in you will get an "App ID". This is a long string of characters and numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy and paste the App ID into MultiMona's "OpenExchangeRates App ID" field and press return.</p>
<p>You then have access to all the exchange rates by using the 'Currency' drop down list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your App ID is saved in your user preferences so you only have to do this once.</p>
