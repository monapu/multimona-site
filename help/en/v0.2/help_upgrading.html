<h2>Upgrading MultiMona</h2>
<p>New versions of MultiMona are released containing bug fixes and new features every so often. We recommend you keep your version of MultiMona up-to-date.</p>
<p>This guide tells you how upgrade to a newer version. It is assumed that you have
  reviewed the <a href="help_gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guide and know where all your wallet files are.</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Locate your wallet files</h3>
<p>If you have a standard installation (i.e. you followed our installation notes) upgrading MultiMona should be a seamless process. Your wallet and configuration files will not be in the same directory as the MultiMona application.</p>
<p>Note: You can create new wallets in <strong>any directory</strong> however we recommend you store your wallets and configuration files separate from the
  installation directory.</p>
<p>You can always see the file location of your current wallet in the main title bar of your MultiMona window. For instance, it might say: "MultiMona - My wallet - /Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiMona/multimona.wallet". The file name at the end is where your wallet is stored.</p>

<h3>Step 2 (optional) - Move your wallets</h3>
<p>If you have stored your wallets in the MultiMona installation directory (this is not recommended) and want to move the wallets out of this directory then please review the <a href="help_movingAWallet.html" target="_blank">Moving A Wallet</a> article.</p>

<h3>Step 3 - Run the installer/ Mac DMG file</h3>
<p>Download the installer from the <a href="http://multimona.sv73.net/" target="_blank">official MultiMona site</a>.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="help_installing.html" target="_blank">standard installation instructions</a> for your computer.</p>

<h3>Step 4 - (Windows and Linux only) Run the old version's uninstaller</h3>
<p>Once you are happy with the new version of MultiMona there is a uninstaller shortcut provided so that you can uninstall the older version of MultiMona.</p>
<p>This is not required on Mac OS X since MultiMona.app is simply overwritten.</p>

<h3>Finish</h3>
<p>That's all there is to it. MultiMona will alert you if there is a problem and the <a href="/help.html">main help contents provide answers</a> to many common questions.</p>
