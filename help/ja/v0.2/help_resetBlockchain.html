<h2>Reset blockchain and transactions</h2>
<p>Occasionally you get transactions that never seem to confirm. If you have a transaction that has not confirmed for
  several hours but you know it is definitely on the blockchain (because you visited Blockchain.info or Blockexplorer.com and checked
  the transaction ID) then you can reset your blockchain.</p>
<p>This process gives MultiMona the opportunity to revisit old transactions. During this process MultiMona will
  check if a transaction has fully confirmed. If so, then it will appear in your transaction list.</p>

<h3>How to reset the blockchain</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Verify that your computer's clock is showing the correct time.</li>
  <li>Open MultiMona and make sure the wallet you are interested in is selected in the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="img/yourWallets.png">&nbsp;Wallets'
    side panel.
  </li>
  <li>Go the 'Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="img/resetTransactions.png">&nbsp;Reset
    Blockchain and Transactions' menu option.
  </li>
  <li>This brings up a new screen. To reset the selected wallet click the '<img width="16" height="16" title="Reset" alt="Reset" src="img/resetTransactions.png">&nbsp;Reset blockchain and
    transactions' button.
  </li>
  <li>MultiMona will start reloading the blockchain. This can take some time. Just let it run and download the
    blockchain. When it is finished, your wallet should reflect what is on the blockchain.
  </li>
</ol>
